# Machine Learning Project 2  

The overall goal of this project is to retrieve roads in an aerial/satellite image. 
 

### <b>project overview</b>

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a pixel in an image to be a road or not.
We will therefore a label to each pixel of a satellite/aerial image (road=1, background=0)

Example : 

<img width="839" alt="road example" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9de1fb79-7a19-49e2-ac62-e50491e1212f">

## How to Run the Code 

You may want to run the code with either run.py or run.ipynb (the latter is more readable in our opinion, the choice is yours).

1. **Clone the repository**  
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone this repository:

   ```bash
   cd YOUR_CLONING_DIRECTORY
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ML_Project2.git
2. **Get the enviroment and activate it**   

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate ML_project2

3. **Run run.py as follow to get the best prediction or simply open run.ipynb on any editor and run all cells**   

   ```bash
   python run.py
